Tasks file description:
main.h:Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

0-binary_to_uint.c: C function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

b is a pointer to a string of 0 and 1 characters.
If b is NULL or there are one or more characters in b that are not 0 or 1 - returns 0.
Otherwise - returns the converted number.
1-print_binary.c: C function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2-get_bit.c: C function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Indices start at 0.
Returns -1 if error.
Else returns the value of the bit at the given index.
3-set_bit.c: C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1.

If an error occurs - returns -1.
Otherwise - returns 1.
4-clear_bit.c: C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0.

Returns -1 if error
Else - returns 1.
5-flip_bits.c: C function that returns the number of bits need to be flipped to get from one number to another.

100-get_endianness.c: C function that checks the endianness.

Returns 0 if Big-endian
Returns 1 if Little-endian
101-password: File containing the password for the crackme3 executable.
