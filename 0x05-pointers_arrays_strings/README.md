# C - Pointer Arrays Strings :page_with_curl: 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
## About this project:
In this project i learnt and practiced;
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables
## Tasks file description;
 * [main.h](main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
 * [0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c): C function that takes a pointer to an
  `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.

  * [1-swap.c](./1-swap.c): C function that swaps the value of two integers.

  * [2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c): C function that returns the length of a string.

  * [3-puts.c](./3-puts.c): C function that prints a string, followed by a new line,
  to `stdout`.

  * [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c): C function that prints a string, in reverse,
  followed by a new line.

  * [5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c): C function that reverses a string.

  * [6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c): C function that prints every other character of a string,
  followed by a new line.

  * [7-puts_half.c](./7-puts_half.c): C function that prints the second half of a string,
  followed by a new line.

  * [8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c): C function that prints an input `n` elements
  of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
    * Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.
    * Numbers are displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array.

  * [9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c): C function that copies the string pointed to by
  `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
    * Returns the pointer to `dest`.

  * [100-atoi.c](./100-atoi.c): C function that converts a string to an integer
  without using `long`, new variable arrays, or hard-coded special values, as follows:
    * The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters.
    * Takes into account all `+` and `-` signs before the number.
    * If there are no numbers in the string, the function returns `0`.

  * [101-keygen.c](./101-keygen.c): C program that generates random valid passwords
  for the program [101-crackme](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x04.c).
